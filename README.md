This Python program implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game of tic-tac-toe using the Tkinter library.   
The game has two players who take turns selecting a button on the 3x3 grid, with one player using 'X' and the other using 'O'.  
The program tracks the number of moves made and checks for a winning combination or a tie. If a player wins, a message box pops up declaring the winner, and the game is over. If the game ends in a tie, a message box declares the game to be over with no winner. The program features two entry boxes that allow the players to enter their names at the start of the game. Once the game is over, the program disables all the buttons on the grid except for the 'exit' button that allows the user to close the game.
